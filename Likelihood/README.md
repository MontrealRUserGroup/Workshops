## Introduction to Likelihood Methods

*Corey Chivers, Department of Biology, McGill University*

This workshop introduces the participant to the likelihood principal and its utility in statistical inference.  By learning how to formalize models of biological processes through their likelihood function, participants will learn how to confront these models with data in order to make statistical inference.
